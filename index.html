<p>Javascript deals with objects in a very loose way, and the more time you spend working with it, more quirks you will find that you will need to get used to. What confuses most developers is how inheritance works, it’s very different than most languages.<br>ES6 introduced a more classical approach to inheritance and will probably be easier to understand if you are struggling.<br>I will show you the newly available classical approach and the regular way of doing it in javascript, then a few other things you should know about objects.</p>

This should be the way you write code as well. You are not done when your code works, you are done when your code looks nice.</p>
<p>How many characters in length do you let your lines go? How well do you organise your code? Is your code open to future demands in features or will the team have to rewrite most of it from scratch? Take some pride on how your code looks.</p>
<p>Other people will see it and you might need to work on it again. When coming back to fix a bug you are not in the same mindset you were when first spending hours or days working on that feature. Review your code to leave it for the future you, so you can read it easily enough.</p>
<p>By spending some extra time reviewing what you did when your focus was to develop the logic of how things would work and taking care of bugs, you can focus on other important stuff. Did you miss a situation where a bug might show up later? Is your code good enough in case you need to extend it later?<br></div><a href="/blog/2016/04/08/Review-your-code/" class="read-more">Read more</a></article></li><li class="post-list-item"><article class="post-block"><h2 class="post-title"><a href="/blog/2015/12/03/Netflix-to-save-the-world/" class="post-title-link">Netflix to save the world</a></h2><div class="post-info">Dec 3, 2015 - 3 min. read</div><div class="post-content"><p>Across history we can see pretty much the same thing happening over and over, a small group controls information and filters what most people should be able to access. Some even change information to produce their own truths. The information that arrives to you has, most likely, already been modified or filtered according to someone else´s point of view or interest.</p>

<p>Around 1439 Gutenberg created a machine that would have a large impact on the world and on how information would be distributed. By making knowledge more accessible, Gutenberg´s new printing system created a revolution disrupting the structure of who hold the knowledge, and empowered the renaissance, the protestant reformation, the age of enlightenment and the scientific revolution.</p>
<p>In the 60s, the creation of networks of computers was again the beginning of a new disruptiveness, the internet makes information a lot easier to access and allows disruptive technologies and applications to grow faster. Every now and then something new comes up and causes chaos, Napster did it and was ultimately crushed, taxi apps did it for local taxi companies, Uber did it and caused mayhem on the streets when taxi drivers attacked the black cars.<br></div><a href="/blog/2015/12/03/Netflix-to-save-the-world/" class="read-more">Read more</a></article></li><li class="post-list-item"><article class="post-block"><h2 class="post-title"><a href="/blog/2015/11/17/Writing-readable-code/" class="post-title-link">Writing readable code</a></h2><div class="post-info">Nov 17, 2015 - 8 min. read</div><div class="post-content"><p>When you are starting on something, be it coding or anything else, more experienced people will give you tips so you can avoid future problems, but many times we will ignore those tips because it doesn’t make sense.

<p>A few years ago I worked on a project that had a few dev teams working together, but each on a different part of the world. A developer from another team was leaving and my team was gonna become responsible for an old software that he was maintaining. Said software was written on a language that I was not used to work with and was using a framework that was long outdated. Fun, right?</p>
<p>I had to look around in the code for where I should work to fulfil my first task. When I found it, I stood there looking at it for a few minutes, probably, without blinking. If this piece of code were a painting, it would be the restored version of Ecce homo.</p>

<p>I know religion can be really important for some people, and that it helped many people in times of distress. But that is pretty much where the benefits ends and mayhem starts. Many might have a healthy relationship with religion and church, but that is not the reality of most.</p>
<p>From now on I will use the word church as a general idea of who dictates the rules for religions, I am not going to go into specific details of different religions. But I am going into their influence on history and everyday life.<br></div><a href="/blog/2015/11/14/Why-I-am-an-atheist/" class="read-more">Read more</a></article></li></ul></main><footer><div class="paginator"><a href="/blog/page/2/" class="next">NEXT</a></div><div class="copyright"><p>powered by <a href="https://hexo.io/" target="_blank">Hexo</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pinggod/hexo-theme-apollo" target="_blank">hexo-theme-apollo</a></p></div></footer></div><script>(function(b,o,i,l,e,r){b.GoogleAnalyticsObject=l;b[l]||(b[l]=function(){(b[l].q=b[l].q||[]).push(arguments)});b[l].l=+new Date;e=o.createElement(i);r=o.getElementsByTagName(i)[0];e.src='//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js';r.parentNode.insertBefore(e,r)}(window,document,'script','ga'));ga('create',"UA-104159899-1",'auto');ga('send','pageview');</script></body></html>
